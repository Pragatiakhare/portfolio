            ✨ I am thrilled to announce that I was selected for the C++ Bootcamp at IIT Bombay! ✨

            From Feb 14-16, I had the incredible opportunity to dive deep into the world of C++, debugging, and
            problem-solving alongside some of the brightest minds.

            Key Learnings:
        <ul>
            <li>💻 Day 1: A deep dive into debugging, led by Prof. Varsha Apte and some core concepts of C++ were taught
                to us by Prof. Ashutosh Gupta at IIT Bombay. We tackled intricate C++ problems, refining our analytical
                skills and approach to debugging.</li>
            <li>🚀 Day 2: The real challenge—a Hackathon! 🏆 I teamed up with my friend Sneha Gupta, and together, we
                gave it our all. At first glance, the problems seemed straightforward, but as we progressed, the
                complexity unfolded. We brainstormed, debugged, and iterated continuously, pushing ourselves to the
                limit. And in the end, we did it! 🎉</li>
            <li>💡 Key Takeaway? "Success is not the absence of failure; it’s the persistence through failure." – A.P.J.

                This bootcamp was more than just about coding—it was about resilience, teamwork, and relentless
                learning. Challenges will always be there, but those who fight till the end emerge stronger. 💪</li>
        </ul>
