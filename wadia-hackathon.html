            🌟 “Behind every line of code, there’s a story of doubt, persistence, and discovery.”  
            I recently participated in the 2nd National Level Project Competition, presenting our project:  
            🛒 <strong>"Optimizing Retail Inventory with Multi Agents"</strong>.  
            What started as a technical challenge became a journey of learning, growth, and teamwork.

            <strong>Problem:</strong> Retail stores face a constant balancing act:  
            ➡️ Stockouts lead to lost sales and unhappy customers 😞  
            ➡️ Overstocking results in high storage costs 📦💸
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Goal:</strong> Build a multi-agent AI system capable of:  
            🔮 Predicting product demand  
            📦 Maintaining ideal inventory  
            💰 Optimizing pricing in real-time  
            🔗 Coordinating between stores, warehouses, and suppliers
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>My Role:</strong> Demand Forecasting Agent  
            Data preprocessing became key: cleaning missing values, encoding variables, scaling features, creating lag features, and hyperparameter tuning.  
            Result? A model with ~99.75% accuracy and deep respect for well-prepared data.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Key Learnings:</strong>  
            - Collaboration is essential; our team—Sneha Gupta, Juideepa Das, Omkar Bholankar, and I—handled different agents and challenges.  
            - Data preprocessing is the foundation of any AI system.  
            - Balancing academics, project work, and life taught us perseverance and time management.
        </p>

            💬 This competition wasn’t just about showcasing a solution—it was about becoming a team that can solve real-world problems.  
            Trust the process; even mistakes shape you into a better engineer and person.
